Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

 - I had difficulties figuring out how to convert to object oriented initially but help hours were very useful and I was able to figure out the logistics of OOP. I had issues mainly with my syntax but I had the general procedural code down pretty well. Additionally I was not able to figure out my mistakes in the main py when I run my code but this seems like a syntax error as well, or a variable definition error. I would advise future students to use all the help they can get with this assignment: use all resources available like Professor Jordan's getting started video, other online videos, online textbook, other online resources, TA hours, office hours, etc.

 - After reviwing this assignment and getting help from the professors I was able to figure out to get the code to run without any erros as well as run all the methods.
